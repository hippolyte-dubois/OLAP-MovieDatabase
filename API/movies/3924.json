Camping on the porch of the Poor House would become the most-used prevalent plot line in the 27 series-films that followed. It was also an issue in the comic-strip for about a year after its inception when it was basically a continuity strip but, aside from Dagwood's inability to coax a pay-raise from Mr. Dithers over the years, the financial status of the family was seldom an issue when the format switched to a gag-a-day strip.","popularity":1.205254,"poster_path":"/xlU9W4QCCJkDrVlDSkiXx6HTiyv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blondie","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":4}
